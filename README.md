# ADBTools

## Android Debug Bridge

Here is the ADBTools which was developed by aojie654 with following editions, for example of description:

- `The Operating System`

- `Program Language`

All the given editions are developed via the special OS and programming language edition.

PS: I was **HIGHLY RECOMMANDED** that you should read the README in programs if you want to use this tool.

### WB : Windows Batch

- Windows 10 Pro 1709 x86_64
- Windows Batch

### LP : Linux Python

- Deepin 15.5 x86_64
- Python 3.6.5 x86_64

### MP : MacOS Python **(But not a dirty word -_^, and it is in developing)**

- Macos X 10.14 Mojave
- Python 3.6.5 (Anaconda3 x64)

PS. I think linux version is running well on macOS so this version is a copy of linux one.
